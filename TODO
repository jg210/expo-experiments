* android unit tests failing on github:
  - need to save https://expo.dev/accounts/jgreen210/projects/expo-experiments/builds/116809ac-e2b8-4a79-a0a6-6e078baa5632
  - not run on EAS?

* Configure eas.
  - chain build environments like described here: https://docs.expo.dev/build/eas-json/#selecting-build-tool-versions
  - set build tool versions in eas.json

* Add a turbomodule too, to compare with the expo native module.

* More react native testing library tests.

* End-to-end test

* Nicer refresh UI?

* dorny/test-reporter for android gradle test results.

* Expo prevents use of eslint 9: https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/28144. eslint 8 is no longer maintained.

* eslint react-hooks/exhaustive-deps disabled.

* Try out https://docs.expo.dev/guides/react-compiler/

* Run expo-doctor on CI?

* iOS implementation for fingerprintAuthorities.
